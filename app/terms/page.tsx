// TERMS FOR THIS WEBSITE, and deliberately nothing more.
//
// This site sells nothing directly: every CTA hands off to Apollo Claw, where the purchase, the
// account and the service relationship live. So these terms cover reading these pages, and say
// plainly that buying an agent is a separate agreement made there. They are NOT a substitute for
// a customer agreement, and the "What you are agreeing to" section says so rather than implying
// this page governs the product.
//
// The no-advice section is matched to THIS agent's domain and mirrors the boundary in the Real
// Estate Agent persona (config/personas.ts in apolloclaw2): a support and drafting tool, not a
// licensed professional, with state-by-state rules that vary.
//
// Not reviewed by a lawyer, and governing law is asserted from the business address rather than
// on advice. Have counsel read this before relying on it.
